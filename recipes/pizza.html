    <p>When you think about Italy, you always think about <em>Pizza</em>. This classic dish of italian origin
        consists in a flattened disk of bread dough, topped with some combination of tomato, mozzarella, 
        oregano and many other ingredients. Baked quickly, most of the times using wool-fired oven
        heated at <strong>very high</strong> temperature.
        <p>This is a recipe for the most classic pizza, the <strong>Margherita</strong>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><strong>300g Strong Bread Flour</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon Instant yeast</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon Salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon Olive Oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>100ml Passata</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Handfull fresh Basil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 Garlic Clove</strong></li>
        <li><strong>125g Ball Mozzarella</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Handfull of grated or shaved Parmesan</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Handful of Cherry Tomatoes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Handful of Basil Leaves</strong></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h1>Steps:</h1></p>

    <p><ol>
        <li><strong>Make the base:</strong> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, 
            pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
            Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
             You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
             then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roll out the Dough:</strong> if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into
             two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
             The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Top and Bake:</strong> heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. 
            Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, 
            on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
