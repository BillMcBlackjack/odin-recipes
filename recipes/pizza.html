    <p>When you think about Italy, you always think about <em>Pizza</em>. This classic dish of italian origin
        consists in a flattened disk of bread dough, topped with some combination of tomato, mozzarella, 
        oregano and many other ingredients. Baked quickly, most of the times using wool-fired oven
        heated at <strong>very high</strong> temperature.
        <p>This is a recipe for the most classic pizza, the <strong>Margherita</strong>.</p>
